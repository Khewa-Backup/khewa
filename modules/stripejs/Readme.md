######  Minimum requirements to use Apple Pay:
-----------------------------------------------------
   - In Safari on an iOS device running iOS 10. Make sure that you have at least one card in your Wallet (you can add one by going to Settings → Wallet & Apple Pay).
   - In Safari on a Mac running macOS Sierra. You will also need an iOS device running iOS 10 with a card in its Wallet to be paired to your Mac via Handoff (instructions on how to do this can be found on Apple Support website.)
   - Devices that support Apple Pay include iPhone 6 or newer, iPhone 6 Plus or newer, iPad Air 2, and iPad mini 3.
   - For testing Apple Pay, please set module in LIVE mode because in TEST mode you need to setup a SANBOX TESTER ACCOUNT for your device which is a long process.
